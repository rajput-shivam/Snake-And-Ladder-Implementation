# Snake-And-Ladder-Implementation
I tried to implement snake and ladder in a different way. This vesrion of Snake and Ladder is different from a conventional Snake and Ladder.
It's features:
1. We can have a board of any size and of any dimension. 
   For Example: 3X3, 10X10, 20X10, 4x8, 1x15
2. The Snakes and the ladder is generated randomly depending upon the size of the board.
   For ExampleL: if the board is 10X10, the code will generated 10 ladders and 10 snakes randomly
                 if the board is 3X3, the code will generate 1 ladder and 1 snake randomly
                 if the board is 4X6, the code will generate 3 ladders and 3 snakes randomly
3. We can have any number of players from 1 to many.
4. I have created a function that prints the board, and all the other details like ladder, snake, and the player position.
