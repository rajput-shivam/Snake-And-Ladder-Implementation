# Snake-And-Ladder-Implementation
I tried to implement snake and ladder in a different way. This version of Snake and Ladder is different from a conventional Snake and Ladder.</br>
Its features:</br>
1. We can have a board of any size and of any dimension.</br>
   For Example: 3X3, 10X10, 4X6, etc</br>
2. The snakes and the ladders are generated randomly depending upon the size of the board.</br>
   For Example: if the board is 10X10, the code will generated 10 ladders and 10 snakes randomly</br>
                if the board is 3X3, the code will generate 1 ladder and 1 snake randomly</br>
                if the board is 4X6, the code will generate 3 ladders and 3 snakes randomly</br>

3. We can have any number of players from 1 to many.</br>
4. The code prints the board, and all the other details like ladder, snake, and the player position with colours.</br>
